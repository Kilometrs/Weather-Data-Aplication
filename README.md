# Weather Data Aplication
## Description
Weather Data Aplication is an application made in Java, that retrieves latest weather infromation of locations from different weather forecast services. This information is then shown in the UI for better accessibility. Retrieved data is also saved to a database and can be accesses in the same UI to have an overlook of data retrieved before for comparing.

## Data sources

## Results
Results retrieved from the services are showed numerically in the UI. Information is parted in several panels based on contex (as site results, average and history). 
The retrieved results (from these forecast services) are saved in a database in two different forms. 
The forms are either raw, which is data directly from sources and averages form, which is calculated city specific raw data. If new city or source is detected, it is also saved to a database as an unique identifier.
